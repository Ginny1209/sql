# Assignment 1: Design a Logical Model

## Question 1
Create a logical model for a small bookstore. ðŸ“š

At the minimum it should have employee, order, sales, customer, and book entities (tables). Determine sensible column and table design based on what you know about these concepts. Keep it simple, but work out sensible relationships to keep tables reasonably sized. Include a date table. There are several tools online you can use, I'd recommend [_Draw.io_](https://www.drawio.com/) or [_LucidChart_](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).

## Question 2
We want to create employee shifts, splitting up the day into morning and evening. Add this to the ERD.

## Question 3
The store wants to keep customer addresses. Propose two architectures for the CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table, one that will retain changes, and another that will overwrite. Which is type 1, which is type 2?

_Hint, search type 1 vs type 2 slowly changing dimensions._

Bonus: Are there privacy implications to this, why or why not?
```
Your answer...
```
type 1 means overwriting the changes, so we only have one record the one customer, once the customer moved, the old address will be replaced by the new address.
type 2 means keep all the versions of the changes, a customer can have multiple records. which means we will hold all the address this customer moved from and to.
obvious, type2 with more private information we got, the risk is higher than type1

## Question 4
Review the AdventureWorks Schema [here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LMu4W.gif)

Highlight at least two differences between it and your ERD. Would you change anything in yours?
```
Your answer...
1. I only have one book store,so we don't have the business entity id.
2. I didn't put in the tax rate, which is something i think I should add into my ERD.if i have different locations in differnt tax rate province, i should also set up different tax rate table.
3. I don't have production or purchasing at all the production tables are not necessary.
4. in the sample shift table, there is shift start time and end time.I think it will be more detailed than just monring and evening shift if some employee cannot make full shift.
