Easy to start, hard to go deep

Over the past two weeks, I have been engaged with the SQL module. I realized I still have a long journey to go before I could really master SQL and land a job as a data professional. As a student pursuing a DSI certificate and hoping to get a BA role, I knew that mastering SQL would be essential for my dream career. 

The initial week felt familiar. Having taken related classes during my Seneca diploma in computer programming, I was comfortable with the foundational concepts. But as the course progressed, I encountered topics that went beyond what I had previously learned. Window functions, cross joins, JSON-to-table transformations, coalesce, and dense rank—all these terms are very overwhelming to us.
During the course, I realized that having a mental library of sample queries was invaluable. Sure, modern tools can assist us, but there’s something empowering about recalling a well-crafted query from memory. These queries are like puzzle pieces—each one unique and capable of solving specific problems.

One highlight of the course was the interview with data professionals from the tech industry. They opened my eyes to the roles within a data team. And the visualization  tools they use, the query they wrote.
But what truly amazed me was the scale of data they dealt with.  Not the modest Excel rows I encounter daily, but massive datasets. Seeing their real-world queries in action broadened my horizons. Suddenly, I understood why SQL was the backbone of data-driven decision-making.

I am more frustrated by excitement. I recognize that my journey has just begun.
